# Hi, I'm Ravi Maurya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **Senior DevOps Engineer/ Site Reliability Engineer** with expertise in cloud automation, Kubernetes, Observability, and Continuous delivery. My work involves helping teams build scalable, automated infrastructure to streamline operations with a rich experience working with global teams. I have extensive knowledge and expertise in software development, operations, and architecture using cloud computing services, focusing on ensuring applications' availability, reliability, and scalability. I always look forward to career progression by shouldering broader responsibilities and achieving organizational goals, while furthering personal and professional development.

When I'm not working, you'll find me learning new technologies or exploring the world of cloud computing, as there is a lot to learn and experience in this world. 
I may not contribute so much to my personal GitHub profile, because I'm usually busy working in private GitHub repositories that I don't own!
